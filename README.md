Critic of critics
=================


Why?
----

 Tons of new movies are released every year and the number of accumulated reviews of movie is increasing. When we are going to choose a movie to watch, there can be diverse refrences or personal preferences such as genre, director or actors. But *Star rating* and *review* are might be the most poular references and this can be proved by looking at information page of NAVER movie, which shows star rating right bellow the title of a movie. In addition, one of the well-knwon movie recommendation service, WATCHA, uses star rating for its core system.

 Anyone can post Star rating and reviews online but we usually classify it based on who made it, an ordinary user, or a critic. A critic is a person who is professional at an area and his or her publish an opinion and assessments of various forms of creative work such as movie. Critical judgments, whether derived from critical thinking or not, may be positive, negative, or balanced, weighing a combination of factors.

 Recently, however, lots of questions are made by lots of movie fans that "Is the review of critics really considerable or not"

 This question makes me to compare the patterns of star ratings between users and critics. I improved this analsis by comparing critics of Korean and other countries. You can conceived of the result as a proof whether skepticism about the quality of critics is right or not.

 PS. I have no negative or positive opinion on critics. Data is just a number, nothing else.
